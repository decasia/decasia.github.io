Hi, I'm Eli Thorkelson. I work on web applications for the [Humanities IT group](http://humanitiescomputing.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/). I started this blog to have an outlet for technical notes about building web applications in the academic context. We're in the middle of moving all our development from vanilla [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) apps to much nicer [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) apps, so that's largely what we'll be talking about.
